This repository provides following custom [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) rules for [Consistence library](https://github.com/consistence/consistence/)

* Check that all classes either extend `\Consistence\ObjectPrototype` or use `\Consistence\Type\ObjectMixinTrait` somewhere in their hierarchy tree.


## Usage

To use those rules, require them in [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require --dev mhujer/phpstan-consistence
```

And include them in your project's PHPStan config:

```yaml
includes:
    - vendor/mhujer/phpstan-consistence/rules.neon
```
